Both switches have an empty MAC address table, and all PCs have an empty ARP table.

1. If PC1 pings to PC3, what messages will be sent over the network, and which devices will receive them?
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REQUEST #1 -> PC3 IP
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REQUEST #1 fails because it doesn't know PC3's MAC address
    PC1 Ping process pauses
    PC1 ARP REQUEST -> FFFF.FFFF.FFFF -> PC1 -> SW1 -> PC2
                                                    SW1 -> SW2 -> PC3
                                                    SW1 -> SW2 -> PC4
    SW1 Rx PC1 ARP REQUEST, dynamically adds PC1 ARP table entry, re-broadcasts to FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
    SW2 Rx, dynamically adds SW1 ARP table entry, re-broadcasts to FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
    All hosts that do not match the IP specified by the ARP request (PC2, PC4) drop the packet
    PC3 confirms IP matches ARP request, dynamically learns PC1 IP+MAC+Interface
    ARP REPLY -> unicast to PC1 IP (sw2->sw1->pc1)
    PC1 resolves PC3's MAC address
    PC1 Ping process resumes
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REQUEST #2 -> PC3 (sw1->sw2->pc3)
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REPLY -> PC1 (sw2->sw1->pc1)
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REQUEST #3 -> PC3 (sw1->sw2->pc3)
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REPLY -> PC1 (sw2->sw1->pc1)
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REQUEST #4 -> PC3 (sw1->sw2->pc3)
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REPLY -> PC1 (sw2->sw1->pc1)
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REQUEST #5 -> PC3 (sw1->sw2->pc3)
    PC1 ICMP ECHO REPLY -> PC1 (sw2->sw1->pc1)
    PC1 Ping process complete
    
2. Send the ping and use Packet Tracer's 'simulation mode' to verify your answer.

3. Use pings to generate network traffic and allow the switches to learn the MAC addresses of all PCs on the network.

4. Use 'show' commands on the switches to identify the MAC address of each PC.

5. Clear the dynamic MAC addresses from the MAC address table of each switch.
